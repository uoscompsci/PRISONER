PRISONER Unit Test Runner

If it runs, test it.

Don't worry too much about where your tests live, so long as they live.
By convention, each module contains a tests directory - segregate your tests
logically as you see fit, and complement the base test suite with your own tests
for additional service gateways, etc.

This test suite:
	- instantiates base Social Objects
