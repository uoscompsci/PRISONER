Getting started
===============

This tutorial helps you get up and running with a PRISONER instance.

Installing PRISONER for local development
-------------------

For developing experiments, you will probably want to run a PRISONER server locally on your development machine to quickly iterate. There are two ways to do
this: using our pre-prepared Docker VM image, or pulling the latest release from
GitHub.

Spin-up a Docker VM
`````````````````````````````
If you have familiarity with the Docker environment, using the PRISONER Docker
container is probably the easiest way to get up and running without having to
worry about your environment and resolving dependencies. We have an image in Docker Hub which includes the latest release from our GitHub repository.

This guide assumes you have installed Docker and are familiar with using it.

To spin-up a PRISONER instance, run the following at the command line::

 TODO: line to spin-up Docker

Now, start-up the VM::

 TODO: line to start instance

Now, PRISONER's development server has started on port 5000. Test that
everything is working, and that Docker has correctly mapped the port by visiting
localhost:<mapped_port>. Depending on your Docker configuration, you may have to
access the underlying VM via an alternative IP.


Clone from GitHub
`````````````````````````````
PRISONER is developed openly, with all active development pushed to GitHub.
We recommend cloning the latest release tag rather than pulling from head for
stability. From the directory where you cloned the repository, run the following
at the command line to install any dependencies::

 pip install -r requirements.txt

We strongly recommend running PRISONER from within a virtualenv to isolate
dependencies and avoid conflicts with your system Python configuration. See
`this guide <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_ for more
information about setting up virtual environments.
