        <p>Thank you for answering all of the questions in our study. This page describes your responses and 
        explains the purpose of the study. Please read the contents of the page and if you have any questions, 
        then feel free to <a href="mailto:tnhh@st-andrews.ac.uk">contact us</a>.</p>
		
        <h2>2. Original project title</h2>
        <p>Social Networks &amp; Health </p>

		<h2>3. Actual project title</h2>
		<p>Ethics in online social network research.</p>
			
		<h2>4. Researcher(s) name(s)</h2>
		<p>Tristan Henderson.</p>
			
		<h2>5. Nature of project</h2>
		<p>This research project was conducted to investigate ethical concerns in online social network research. 
		Lots of research projects, such as the project that you were just asked to participate in, use online 
		social network data. But there are many concerns about using such data, for instance privacy risks if sensitive 
		health data are leaked, or if knowledge about friendships are exposed. Some common examples include battered 
		spouses who might not want their spouses to be able to find them, but this might be possible if they were to 
		contact a friend of a friend, or employees who might not want their employers to see their after-work 
		activities on Facebook.</p>
			
		<p>To explore these issues we have asked you to share some of your online social network data with us. 
		To do this, we deceived you by telling you that you were were participating in a research project about <strong>
		Social Networks &amp; Health</strong>. This is an example of a real research project that has taken place in the recent past. 
		In actual fact we have not been investigating this, but rather we have been interested in what type of information you were 
		willing to share with us. We are not interested in the actual data themselves, and so we have <strong>not</strong> stored 
        any of your social network data. The only information that we have stored is whether you were willing to share any of the
        pieces of information that were presented to you.</p>
			
		<p>It was necessary to deceive you because if we had explained that we were not storing any of your data, you may have 
        over-shared with us since the risks were minimal. If you are uncomfortable with this, then please contact the
        researchers using the details below.</p>
			
		<p>From the outcomes of this research we hope to be able to create some guidelines for researchers who wish to use online social 
		network data. For instance, if we find that there are particular types of data that participants seem very unwilling to share, then 
		researchers ought to determine ways of using other types of data rather than these.</p>
			
		<h2>6. Storage of data</h2>
		<p>As outlined in the Participant Information Sheet your data will now be retained for a period of 10 years before 
		being destroyed. <strong>But</strong> as explained above, the only data that will be stored will be information about what types of data 
		you were willing to share. These will not be stored with any identifier indicating you. If you are unhappy with 
		this then you are free to withdraw your consent by <a href="mailto:tnhh@st-andrews.ac.uk">contacting us</a>. 
		Your data will remain accessible to only the researchers or it may be used for future scholarly purposes without further 
		contact or permission if you have given permission on the Consent Form.</p>
			
		<p>We will store your Facebook username in a separate database for the duration of the study. This is to prevent 
		participants from taking the study again. These usernames will not be associated with any of the data. We will also 
		store your e-mail address in order to contact you with details of your Amazon voucher. Once the study is complete, we will delete 
		these e-mail addresses, unless you have given us consent to store your details to contact you when papers about the study 
		are made available.</p>
			
		<h2>7. What should I do if I have concerns about this study?</h2>
		<p>If you have any concerns about the procedures used in this study, or would like to know any more information about 
		the methods used or this area of research, then please contact the researchers using the details below. A full outline 
		of the procedures governed by the University Teaching and Research Ethical Committee are outlined on their 
		website <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/utrec/complaints/" target="_blank">http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/utrec/complaints/</a></p>
