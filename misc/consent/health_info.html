		<h1>Social Networks &amp; Health - Information</h1>

        <p>Thank you for your interest in our research study. This page explains the purpose of the study and your involvement.
        Please read this entire page before using the "Next" button to proceed to the next page.</p>

		<h2>1. What is the study about?</h2>
		<p>We invite you to participate in a research project about the social factors that affect your health and health care. 
We are interested in understanding how health behaviours spread through friends and social networks. For instance, if one member of your 
social network has a very healthy lifestyle, does this mean that other members of your social network will also have a healthy lifestyle? 
Similarly, if one member is depressed, does that depression spread through to other friends?
<br />
		This study is being conducted as part of our research in the <a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/" target="_blank">School 
		of Computer Science</a>.</p>
	
		<h2>2. Do I have to take part?</h2>
		<p>Participation is completely voluntary. You should read the information on this page and then decide 
		whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part you will be free to withdraw at any 
		time without providing a reason. You can do so by closing your web browser. 
		All of your personal data will then be deleted.</p>
	
		<h2>3. What would I be required to do?</h2>
		<p>You will be asked to complete a questionnaire in your browser. We anticipate that this will 
		take 30 minutes to complete. You will be presented with data from your Facebook social network that we 
		require for our research. You will then be asked whether you are willing to share these data with us. 
		It is completely up to you whether to share your data with us or not. If you do agree, then your data 
        will be stored and processed for the purposes of our research. If you do not use Facebook, then you
        will be unable to participate in the study.</p>
	
		<h2>4. Will my participation be anonymous and confidential?</h2>
        <p>For the purposes of our research, we need to know your name and institution (e.g., university attended), and
        other data that you have stored in your Facebook account. 
		We would also like to have similar information for other members of your social network. It is up to you 
		whether to share these data or not. <br />
		All data will be stored by the researchers in a secure fashion. We would like to share these data with 
		other researchers to be used for future scholarly purposes. Again, this is up to you. You should 
		indicate whether you are willing to do so in the following questionnaire.</p>
	
		<h2>5. Storage and destruction of data collected</h2>
		<p>The data we collect will be accessible by the researcher(s) and supervisor(s) involved in this study only, 
		unless explicit consent for wider access is given by means of the consent form. Your data will be stored 
		for a period of at least 10 years before being destroyed, in an unanonymised format on a secure server in 
		our University.</p>
	
		<h2><a id="further_info">6. What will happen to the results of the research study?</a></h2>
		<p>We expect to have the results of this study ready by the end of 2012. They will be published in various 
		research papers. If you wish to know more about the research or have copies of the papers sent to you, then please 
		indicate this here.</p>

		<h2>7. Reward</h2>
		<p>You will receive a Â£5 Amazon.co.uk gift voucher for successfully completing this survey.</p>
	
		<h2>8. Are there any potential risks to taking part?</h2>
		<p>The risks of taking part involve sharing your online social network data with us. As part of the questionnaire, 
		you will tell us what data you are willing to share. This gives you the ability to manage these risks. If there are 
		any data that you do not wish to share, then please indicate as such in the questionnaire.</p>

		approval process and has been given the approval code CS8772.</p>
