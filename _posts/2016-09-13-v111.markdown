A minor bug release, [PRISONER v1.1.1 has been released]
(https://github.com/uoscompsci/PRISONER/releases/tag/v1.1.1). This fixes an
issue with deprecated Facebook permissions, and a small bug in the Docker demo.
Updating is highly recommended if using Facebook.

The PRISONER Docker image and Docker demo have been updated to this version.

## Changelog

### Bug fixes

* Deprecated Facebook permission read_stream has been replaced with user_posts.
The Facebook Gateway now targets version 2.4 of the Graph API and future
experiments should request at least this in the "api_version" prop.

* Docker demo template had a syntax error in its conditionals.
